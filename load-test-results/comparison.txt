Performance Comparison: ResultMap vs Stream

Test Configuration:
- Requests: 1000
- Concurrency: 10

ResultMap Approach:
- Requests per second: 51.06
- Mean response time: 195.37 ms
- 95th percentile response time: 241 ms

Stream Approach:
- Requests per second: 55.74
- Mean response time: 178.73 ms
- 95th percentile response time: 240 ms

Performance Difference:
- Requests per second: 9.16% (Stream vs ResultMap)
- Mean response time: -8.52% (Stream vs ResultMap)
- 95th percentile response time: 0.00% (Stream vs ResultMap)

Conclusion:
The Stream approach has higher throughput than the ResultMap approach.
The Stream approach has lower average response time than the ResultMap approach.

Recommendation:
The Stream approach is recommended for better performance.
